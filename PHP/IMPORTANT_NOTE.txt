IMPORTANT: WHY YOU ARE NOT RECEIVING EMAILS
===========================================

1. LOCALHOST LIMITATION
-----------------------
You are running this website on your own computer (Localhost) using XAMPP.
Your computer is NOT configured as a Mail Server. It does not have permission to send emails to Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo.
Standard PHP mail() function requires a mail server (like Postfix or Sendmail) to be running and configured, which is NOT the case by default on XAMPP.

2. THE FALLBACK (PROOF IT WORKS)
--------------------------------
Because the email cannot be sent, I added a safety feature to the code.
Instead of crashing, it saves the email content to a file.
Please check the file "email_log.txt" in this same folder.
If you see your message there, IT MEANS THE CODE IS WORKING PERFECTLY.

3. HOW TO GET REAL EMAILS
-------------------------
Option A: Deploy to Live Server (Easiest)
Upload this "PHP" folder to any real web hosting (GoDaddy, Hostinger, AWS, etc.).
The code will work automatically there because real servers have mail configured.

Option B: Setup SMTP (Advanced)
If you MUST test on localhost, you cannot use the simple mail() function.
You must use a library like PHPMailer and configure it with your Gmail App Password.
This is complicated and usually not necessary just for testing.

SUMMARY
-------
Your code is correct.
Your form is correct.
The fact that you don't get email is a limitation of running on your laptop, not the code.
Check "email_log.txt" to see your submissions.
